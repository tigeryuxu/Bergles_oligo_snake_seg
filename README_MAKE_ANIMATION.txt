(1) Run script with scale_for_animation = 1  (or < 1 for scaling down)

(2) Run imageJ script to convert to combined RGB stacks
(3) load into Vaa3d using "import" >> import general series as timeseries
		- ***use combine across channels

(4) then film animation, in "others"
	- 400 time points per rotation ==> i.e. # of total frames you have
	- 20 secs per rotation

	- 200 frames per rotation


(5) and export as '.BMP'
(6) which can then be converted to .avi by loading into FIJI


***note: will appear in black and white first!!! But when you open up in 3D mode, it will be correct colors
